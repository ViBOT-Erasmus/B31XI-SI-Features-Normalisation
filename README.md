# Feature Normalization

**Table-of-contents**

* [Dependencies](#dependencies)
* [Feature normalization](#features-normalization)
* [To perform the practise](#to-perform-the-practise)

More description is given in the subsections.

## Dependencies

The following practise has been tested with **Ubuntu 14.04**.

In order to use the Ipython Notebook, the following dependencies are needed:

* IPython - `sudo apt-get install ipython`
* IPython notebook - `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`
* Numpy - `sudo apt-get install numpy`
* Matplotlib - `sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib`
* Scikit-learn - `sudo apt-get install python-sklearn`

We strongly recommend to use a Linux environment to perform this practise.

## Features normalization

Synthetic data will be generated. Simple classification using Leave-One-Patient-Out cross-validation will be performed in order to show the importance of features normalization previous to classification.

## To perform the practise

### Assignment procedure

In order to perform the practise, you will have to fork the current project. To do so,

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the current project by click on the Fork icon ![Do not fine the icon](./readme-images/fork-icon.png),
- Select your GitHub profile if necessary,
- Clone the repository ![Do not fine the icon](./readme-images/git-clone.png),
- Solve the practise by executing the Ipython notebook,
- Commit & push your changes in your own repository,
- Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### Execute the Ipython notebook

Enter the following command in a terminal `ipython notebook`.

This command should run the server locally via your default web browser and you will be able to play with the notebook.

Enjoy!!!
